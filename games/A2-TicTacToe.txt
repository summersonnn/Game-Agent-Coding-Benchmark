Tic Tac Toe is a game played on a 3x3 grid between two players who alternate placing their marks ('X' and 'O') in empty cells. X always moves first.

The objective is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). If all 9 cells are filled and no player has achieved three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

You'll receive the game's source code, but the implementation of the TicTacToeAgent will be empty. Your task is to develop your own algorithms and strategies to build the TicTacToeAgent class. Your agent will compete head-to-head against another AI-generated agent. Ensure that your agent adheres to the game rules and is capable of playing effectively.

IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the TicTacToeAgent class definition and any additional imports you need (beyond `random` which is already available). Do NOT output the entire game code.

## Board Layout

The board is a flat list of 9 cells indexed 0-8:

```
  0 | 1 | 2
 -----------
  3 | 4 | 5
 -----------
  6 | 7 | 8
```

Each cell contains `' '` (empty), `'X'`, or `'O'`.

## Agent Interface

Your agent receives its assigned symbol ('X' or 'O') at construction time. The `make_move` method receives a copy of the current board and must return a single integer (0-8) representing the cell to mark.

- **Constructor:** `__init__(self, name: str, symbol: str)` where symbol is 'X' or 'O'.
- **Move method:** `make_move(self, board: list[str]) -> int` where board is a list of 9 strings.
- **Return value:** An integer 0-8 corresponding to an empty cell.
- **Invalid moves** (out of range, occupied cell, non-integer, crash, timeout) result in a random valid move being played instead. There are no retries.

## Competition Format

- 1 vs 1 match, 100 games per match.
- Starting symbol (X/O) is randomized each game.

### Match Points (Primary Metric)
- **Win:** 3 points
- **Draw:** 1 point each
- **Loss:** 0 points

### Tie-Breaker Score (Secondary Metric)
- **Win:** `max(empty_cells_remaining, 3)` -- rewards winning quickly.
- **Loss:** `-max(empty_cells_remaining, 3)` -- the negation of the winner's score.
- **Draw:** 0 for both players.

### Error Handling
| Failure Type         | Consequence                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| make_move() Crash    | Random valid move played; game continues.             |
| Initialization Crash | Immediate game forfeit. Opponent wins with max score. |
| Move Timeout (1s)    | Random valid move played; game continues.             |
| Invalid Move         | Random valid move played; game continues.             |
