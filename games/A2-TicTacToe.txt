Tic Tac Toe is a game played on a 5x5 grid between two players who alternate placing their marks ('X' and 'O') in empty cells. X always moves first, but the first move for X is placed randomly by the game engine.

The objective is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). If all 25 cells are filled and no player has achieved three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

You'll receive the game's source code, but the implementation of the TicTacToeAgent will be empty. Your task is to develop your own algorithms and strategies to build the TicTacToeAgent class. Your agent will compete head-to-head against another AI-generated agent. Ensure that your agent adheres to the game rules and is capable of playing effectively.

### Agent Coding Requirements
- **No Internal Imports**: Do not import any game engine files, match runners, or project-specific modules. Use only standard library imports.
- **Isolation**: Your agent must be completely self-contained. Do not assume any specific file structure or directory hierarchy.
- **Class-Only Output**: Output ONLY the agent class and necessary standard imports. Do not include testing code, game logic outside the class, or example usage.
- **No Broad Exception Handlers**: Do not wrap the body of `make_move()` in a broad exception handler such as `except Exception:`, `except BaseException:`, or a bare `except:`. The engine uses `signal.alarm` to enforce move time limits; broad catches will swallow the timeout exception and cause the match to hang.


IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the TicTacToeAgent class definition and any additional imports you need (beyond `random` which is already available). Do NOT output the entire game code.

## Board Layout

The board is a flat list of 25 cells indexed 0-24:

```
   0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4
 -----------------------
   5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9
 -----------------------
  10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14
 -----------------------
  15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19
 -----------------------
  20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24
```

Each cell contains `' '` (empty), `'X'`, or `'O'`.

## Agent Interface

Your agent receives its assigned symbol ('X' or 'O') at construction time. The `make_move` method receives a copy of the current board and must return a single integer (0-24) representing the cell to mark.

- **Constructor:** `__init__(self, name: str, symbol: str)` where symbol is 'X' or 'O'.
- **Move method:** `make_move(self, board: list[str]) -> int` where board is a list of 25 strings.
- **Return value:** An integer 0-24 corresponding to an empty cell.
- **Invalid moves** (out of range, occupied cell, non-integer, crash, timeout) result in a random valid move being played instead. There are no retries.

## Competition Format

- 1 vs 1 match, 100 games per match.
- Starting symbol (X/O) alternates each game.
- The first move for X is placed randomly by the game engine before agents start playing.

### Match Points (Primary Metric)
- **Win:** 3 points
- **Draw:** 1 point each
- **Loss:** 0 points

### Tie-Breaker Score (Secondary Metric)
- **Win:** `max(empty_cells_remaining, 3)` -- rewards winning quickly.
- **Loss:** `-max(empty_cells_remaining, 3)` -- the negation of the winner's score.
- **Draw:** 0 for both players.

### Error Handling
| Failure Type         | Consequence                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| make_move() Crash    | Random valid move played; game continues.             |
| Initialization Crash | Immediate game forfeit. Opponent wins with max score. |
| Move Timeout (1s)    | Random valid move played; game continues.             |
| Invalid Move         | Random valid move played; game continues.             |
