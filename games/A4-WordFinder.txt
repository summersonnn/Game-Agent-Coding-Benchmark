WordFinder is a 2-player word game where you must find a word that connects to the previous word.

## Game Overview

The game starts with a random word from the dictionary.
Players take turns finding a new word based on the previous word.
Each game lasts up to 100 rounds (200 individual turns, 100 per player).
The player with the higher score at the end wins.

## Rules

1. **Letter Constraint**: The new word must CONTAIN the **first** and **last** letters of the previous word.
2. **Position Constraint**: The required letters (first/last of previous word) CANNOT be the first or last letters of the new word.
   - Example: Previous word "PUSH" (starts with 'P', ends with 'H').
   - You need a word containing 'P' and 'H'.
   - 'P' cannot be the first or last letter of your new word.
   - 'H' cannot be the first or last letter of your new word.
   - Valid: "ACCOMPLISHMENT" (contains 'P' and 'H', neither is at start/end).
   - Invalid: "POINT" (starts with 'P').
   - Invalid: "HELP" (ends with 'P', starts with 'H').
3. **Length Constraint**: Your word's length CANNOT equal the previous word's length.
   - Example: If previous word is "TELEPHONE" (9 letters), you cannot use a 9-letter word.
   - Valid: "ACCOMPLISHMENT" (14 letters != 9).
   - Invalid: "SUPERHERO" (9 letters = 9).
4. **Uniqueness**: A word can never be repeated in the game (by either player).
5. **Dictionary**: The word must be a valid English word (present in the game's dictionary).

## Scoring

- **Base Points**: You gain points equal to the **length** of your valid word.
- **Hyphen Penalty**: Words containing a hyphen ("-") get **half points** (length / 2).
  - Example: "MOTHER-IN-LAW" (13 letters) = 13 / 2 = **6 base points**
- **Consecutive Letter Bonus**: If the two required letters (first and last of the previous word) appear **consecutively** in your word, your base points are **multiplied by 2**!
  - Example: Previous word "PUSH" (requires 'P' and 'H').
  - Word "SHEPHERD" contains "PH" consecutively -> 8 letters x 2 = **16 points**
  - Word "TELEPATHY" contains 'P' and 'H' but not consecutively -> **9 points** (no bonus)
  - The letters can appear in either order: "PH" or "HP" both trigger the bonus.
  - The 2x bonus is applied AFTER the hyphen penalty if applicable.

## Partial Move (Last Resort)

If you believe there is NO valid word that contains BOTH required letters, you have a fallback option:

- **Partial Move**: Play a word that contains only ONE of the required letters (not at start/end position).
  - The game continues (does NOT end).
  - You receive **NEGATIVE points** (a penalty based on word length).
  - Example: Previous word "QUIZ" (requires 'Q' and 'Z'). No word has both? Play "LIQUID" (contains 'Q' but not 'Z').
    - You lose points, but the game continues.

**IMPORTANT**:
- This is a LAST RESORT when no valid word exists.
- If you play a partial move when a valid word WAS available, you're throwing away points unnecessarily.
- If your word contains NEITHER required letter (or has them at start/end), it's treated as an invalid move.

## Accessing the Word Dictionary

**CRITICAL**: The game environment provides a global function `load_words()` that returns a set of all valid words (lowercase).

You MUST use this function to access the dictionary:

```python
class WordFinderAgent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.dictionary = load_words()  # Returns a set of lowercase words
```

**DO NOT** hardcode your own word list. **DO NOT** try to load from a file path yourself. The `load_words()` function is already available in the game environment.

## Competition Format

- 1 vs 1 match, multiple games per match.
- Starting agent is randomized each game.
- Each game lasts up to 100 rounds (200 individual turns).

### Match Points (Primary Metric)
- **Win:** 3 points
- **Draw:** 1 point each
- **Loss:** 0 points

### Tie-Breaker Score (Secondary Metric)
- **Win:** The in-game score difference between winner and loser.
- **Loss:** The negation of the winner's score difference (negative).
- **Draw:** 0 for both players.

### Error Handling
| Failure Type         | Consequence                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| make_move() Crash    | -10 point penalty; game continues; turn switches.     |
| Initialization Crash | Immediate game forfeit. Opponent wins with max score. |
| Move Timeout         | -10 point penalty; game continues; turn switches.     |
| Invalid Move         | -10 point penalty; game continues; turn switches.     |

## WordFinderAgent Interface

```python
import random


class WordFinderAgent:
    """
    Your agent implementation goes here.
    """
    def __init__(self, name):
        """
        Initialize your agent.
        """
        self.name = name
        self.dictionary = load_words()  # Load the full word dictionary

    def make_move(self, current_word, word_history):
        """
        Called when it's your turn.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        current_word : str
            The word played by the opponent (or the starting word).

        word_history : set
            A set of all words that have been used so far in the game (by both players).
            This includes the current_word and all previous words.
            You MUST NOT return a word that is in this set.

        Returns:
        --------
        str
            Your word choice.
        """
        # TODO: Implement your strategy
        # 1. Find the required characters from current_word (first and last char)
        # 2. Search for a valid word that:
        #    - Contains those characters
        #    - Does not have them at start or end
        #    - Has a DIFFERENT length than current_word
        #    - Is NOT in word_history (very important!)
        #    - Is in self.dictionary
        # 3. Optimize for length (points) and difficulty for opponent

        return "example"
```

**IMPORTANT**: Output ONLY the WordFinderAgent class definition and any additional imports you need (random is already available). Do NOT output the entire game code.

## Strategy Tips

1. **Hunt for Bonuses**: Look for words with the required letters appearing consecutively - a 2x multiplier is huge!
2. **Avoid Hyphens**: Words with hyphens get only half points.
3. **Choose long words**: Longer words give more base points.
4. **Pre-compute When Possible**: Build lookup tables in `__init__` (runs once, not timed) rather than searching the full dictionary in `make_move` (runs every turn, timed).
5. **Use word_history**: The game provides you with the complete history of used words. Check against it to avoid penalties.
6. **Defensive Play**: Avoid leaving the opponent with easy letters (common letters like 'E', 'S' at start/end of your word).
7. **Offensive Play**: Try to force the opponent into a situation where they have to use difficult letters.
8. **Partial Move Fallback**: If absolutely NO valid word exists, use a partial move (one required letter) to avoid the -10 invalid penalty. It costs negative points but is better than an invalid move.
