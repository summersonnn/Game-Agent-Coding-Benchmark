Wizard is a trick-taking card game for 3-6 players. In this competition, you will play with exactly 6 players (AI agents).

## Game Overview

The objective is to correctly bid the number of tricks you will win in each round, then play your cards strategically to achieve that exact number. Points are awarded for correct bids and subtracted for incorrect ones.

## Deck Composition

A Wizard deck consists of 60 cards:
- 52 standard playing cards (ranks 2-10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace in four suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades)
- 4 Wizards (highest value, always trump)
- 4 Jesters (lowest value, always lose)

## Game Structure

The game is played in 10 rounds (since 60 cards / 6 players = 10 rounds):
- Round 1: Each player gets 1 card
- Round 2: Each player gets 2 cards
- ...
- Round 10: Each player gets 10 cards

Each round has three phases:
1. **Dealing**: Cards are dealt, and the top card of the remaining deck determines trump suit
2. **Bidding**: Each player bids how many tricks they expect to win (0 to number of cards dealt)
3. **Playing**: Players play tricks, with the highest card winning each trick

## Trump Suit Determination

After dealing, the top card of the remaining deck is revealed:
- If it's a **standard card**: That suit becomes trump for this round
- If it's a **Jester**: No trump suit this round (only Wizards are trump)
- If it's a **Wizard**: The dealer chooses the trump suit
- If there are **no cards left** after dealing: No trump suit this round

## Bidding Phase

The dealer rotates one seat clockwise each round: in round 1 the dealer is seat 0, in round 2 seat 1, and so on (modulo 6). Bidding starts with the player immediately after the dealer and proceeds clockwise, so the dealer bids last.

The `turn_order` field in the game state gives the exact seat sequence for the current round (e.g. `[2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 1]` means seat 2 bids first, seat 1 bids last). You can use this to know your position in the bidding order.

**LEGAL BIDS**: Any integer from 0 to N, where N is the number of cards dealt this round.

**THE HOOK RULE** (CRITICAL): The **last player to bid** (the dealer — whichever seat that is this round, given by `turn_order[-1]`) has one additional restriction:
- They **CANNOT** bid a number that would make the sum of all bids equal the total number of tricks available.
- Example: In Round 4 (4 tricks available), if the first 5 players bid [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] (sum = 3), then the last bidder **cannot** bid 1 (which would make the total 4). They must bid 0, 2, 3, or 4.
- This rule ensures that at least one player will not make their bid exactly.
- If you are the last bidder and your returned bid violates this rule, it will be replaced with a random valid bid.
- To detect whether you are the last bidder: check if `game_state["my_position"] == game_state["turn_order"][-1]`.

**IMPORTANT**: You must return exactly one integer. Invalid bids (non-integers, negative numbers, or numbers greater than cards dealt) will be replaced with a random valid bid.

## Playing Phase

Players take turns playing one card per trick. The player who played the highest card wins the trick and leads the next trick.

### Card Hierarchy and Trick-Taking Rules

**Card Values (lowest to highest)**:
1. **Jester**: Always loses (unless all cards in the trick are Jesters, then first Jester wins)
2. **Standard cards**: Ranked 2 (lowest) to Ace (highest)
3. **Wizard**: Always wins (if multiple Wizards, first one wins)

**Trump Suits**: Trump suit cards beat non-trump suit cards of the same type.

**Following Suit Rules** (CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY):

1. **If the first card played is a Wizard**:
   - No suit requirement - all players may play any card
   
2. **If the first card played is a Jester**:
   - The first **standard card** played determines the suit that must be followed
   - If all cards are Jesters, no suit requirement
   
3. **If the first card is a standard card**:
   - That card's suit must be followed if possible
   - **MUST FOLLOW SUIT**: If you have any standard cards in that suit, you must play one
   - **Wizards and Jesters can ALWAYS be played** regardless of your hand
   - If you have no cards in the led suit (and no Wizards/Jesters), you may play any card

**LEGAL PLAYS**:
- If suit was led and you have cards in that suit: Must play a card in that suit OR a Wizard/Jester
- If suit was led and you have NO cards in that suit: May play any card
- If no suit requirement (first card is Wizard or all Jesters): May play any card

**ILLEGAL PLAYS** (will be replaced with random valid card):
- Playing an off-suit standard card when you have cards in the led suit
- Playing a card not in your hand
- Not returning a valid card object

### Trick Winner Determination

1. If any **Wizards** were played: First Wizard wins
2. If only **Jesters** were played: First Jester wins
3. Otherwise: Highest trump suit card wins (if any trump was played)
4. Otherwise: Highest card in the led suit wins

## Scoring

At the end of each round:
- **Correct bid**: Score = 20 + (10 × tricks_won)
- **Incorrect bid**: Score = -(10 × |bid - tricks_won|)

Example:
- Bid 3, won 3 tricks: +20 + 30 = +50 points
- Bid 0, won 0 tricks: +20 + 0 = +20 points
- Bid 2, won 4 tricks: -10 × 2 = -20 points

## Error Handling

| Failure Type | Consequence |
| --- | --- |
| make_move() Crash | Random valid move played; game continues. |
| Initialization Crash | Agent replaced with random bot for that game; other_crash incremented. |
| Move Timeout | Random valid move played; game continues. |
| Invalid Move | Random valid move played; game continues. |

## Implementation Task

You will receive the game's source code, but the implementation of the WizardAgent will be empty. Your task is to develop your own algorithms and strategies to build the WizardAgent class. Your agent will compete against 5 other AI-generated agents in a 6-player game.

### Agent Coding Requirements
- **No Internal Imports**: Do not import any game engine files, match runners, or project-specific modules. Use only standard library imports.
- **Isolation**: Your agent must be completely self-contained. Do not assume any specific file structure or directory hierarchy.
- **Single Class Implementation**: Do not implement any class other than the one provided in the starter code.
- **Class-Only Output**: Output ONLY the agent class and necessary standard imports. Do not include testing code, game logic outside the class, or example usage.
- **No Broad Exception Handlers**: Do not wrap the body of `make_move()` in a broad exception handler such as `except Exception:`, `except BaseException:`, or a bare `except:`. The engine uses `signal.alarm` to enforce move time limits; broad catches will swallow the timeout exception and cause the match to hang.



**IMPORTANT**: Output ONLY the WizardAgent class definition and any additional imports you need (beyond random which is already available). Do NOT output the entire game code.

## Strategy Tips

1. **Bidding**: Analyze your hand strength, considering:
   - Number of Wizards (guaranteed wins)
   - Number of high trump cards
   - Number of Aces in other suits
   - Void suits (you can trump in)

2. **Playing**:
   - If trying to win a trick: Play high cards or Wizards
   - If trying to avoid winning: Play Jesters or low cards
   - Use `played_tricks` to track which cards have already been played — this lets you deduce which high cards are still live, identify opponent void suits, and calculate safe plays
   - Remember other players' bids to predict their strategy

3. **Scoring**: Bidding 0 and achieving it gives 20 points - a safe strategy with weak hands

4. **Trump Management**: Use trump cards wisely, especially when trying to fulfill your bid

**Competition Format**:

In this competition, 6 different LLMs compete against each other. Each LLM provides 1 agent.

- **Total Players**: 6 agents (Agent-1 through Agent-6), each from a different model
- **Seating**: Seat positions rotate each game for fairness

Multiple games are played per match. After each game, agents are ranked by their
Wizard score (sum of round scores). Rank-based match points are awarded per game:
  1st place: 5 points, 2nd: 4, 3rd: 3, 4th: 2, 5th: 1, 6th: 0

Ties share the average of their tied positions' points.
Your tie-breaker score is your accumulated raw Wizard in-game score across all games.
